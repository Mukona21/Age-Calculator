# Age Calculator

This is a simple web-based age calculator that calculates the age of a person based on their date of birth. It utilizes the React and Vue JavaScript libraries to provide an interactive and responsive user interface.

## Requirements

This program requires Node.js and npm to be installed. Once installed, you can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the age calculator, simply run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Once the application is loaded, enter your date of birth in the input fields provided. The format should be in year, month, and day. Once you've entered your date of birth, click the "Calculate Age" button to see your age displayed on the screen.
